A native Home Assistant **integration** (not an add-on) for monitoring and controlling Sunsynk and Deye hybrid solar inverters via the Sunsynk cloud API.

> **Note:** This integration communicates with the **Sunsynk cloud API** (`api.sunsynk.net` or `pv.inteless.com`). Your inverter must already be connected to the cloud via the Sunsynk dongle/Wi-Fi stick.

---

## Why this project exists

SunSynk HA Integration began as a small project with one practical idea: an
inverter should behave like a native Home Assistant device. Monitoring, entities,
services and automations should live in Home Assistant itself, without requiring
a separate add-on, virtual machine, container, MQTT bridge or second automation
platform to maintain.

What looked simple at first became a much deeper engineering problem as the
community tested the integration on real systems. Inverter models and firmware do
not always behave alike; writes can be acknowledged before they reach the device;
timer settings interact in groups; and parallel installations have master/slave
rules that the public API does not explain. In some cases a slave even accepts a
setting and only reverts it to the master's value several seconds later.

The project has grown around those discoveries while keeping the original goal:
a safe, understandable and genuinely native Home Assistant experience. Thank you
to everyone who has reported bugs, supplied diagnostics and portal comparisons,
and tested fixes on real single-, multi- and parallel-inverter installations.
The difficult reports are what made the integration better.

---

## Prerequisites

1. A **Sunsynk account** at [https://home.sunsynk.net](https://home.sunsynk.net) (no MFA — multi-factor authentication is not supported by the API)
2. Your inverter connected to the Sunsynk cloud (dongle shows green / data visible in the Sunsynk app)
3. Your **inverter serial number** (visible in the Sunsynk app under _Device_ → _About_)

---

   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant

---

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**
2. Search for **Sunsynk**
3. Fill in the form:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **API Server** | `api.sunsynk.net` (Sunsynk) or `pv.inteless.com` (Deye/Inteless) |
| **Email** | Your Sunsynk account email |
| **Password** | Your Sunsynk account password |
| **Serial Number(s)** | Inverter serial number. For multiple inverters separate with `;` e.g. `SN123456;SN789012` |
| **Refresh Interval** | How often to poll the API in seconds (min 60, default 300) |

4. Click **Submit** — HA will validate your credentials and create the integration

---

## Dashboard

A ready-made Lovelace dashboard is included in [`dashboards/sunsynk-dashboard.yaml`](dashboards/sunsynk-dashboard.yaml).  
It provides four views: **Overview** (Power Flow Card), **Charts**, **Settings**, and **Diagnostics**.

Automatic dashboard creation is **disabled by default**. To opt in, open
**Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → Configure**, enable **Create and
maintain Sunsynk dashboard**, and submit. Only then will the integration
register its bundled Power Flow Card resource and create/update its Lovelace
dashboard for each configured inverter. Each dashboard uses that inverter’s own
entities and includes its own Charts view. With two or more configured inverters,
the integration also creates **Solar Overview**, showing labelled power flows
and comparison charts for all inverters. Readings stay separate: the overview
does not add shared battery, grid or load measurements into system totals.
Its daily generation graph uses daily changes in each inverter’s lifetime solar
energy counter. With this option disabled, the integration does not modify
Lovelace.

Dashboards appear as **Solar <inverter alias>** in the sidebar and under
**Settings → Dashboards**. Open the **Charts** tab (line-chart icon) for history
and energy graphs. If no dashboard appears after enabling the option, restart
Home Assistant fully and refresh the browser; the storage fallback registers
dashboards on the next startup.

> **Note:** The **Sunsynk Power Flow Card** (v7.3.3 by slipx06) is bundled with
> this integration. No separate HACS installation is needed when the dashboard
> option is enabled.

### Manual import alternative

If you prefer to manage Lovelace yourself, leave the automatic option disabled,
add `/sunsynk/sunsynk-power-flow-card.js` as a JavaScript module resource, and
import the supplied YAML:

1. **Find your entity prefix**  
   Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → click your device → click any sensor (e.g. Battery SOC)  
   Note the Entity ID, e.g. `sensor.sunsynk_battery_soc` → your prefix is **`sunsynk`**

2. **Open the dashboard file**, find & replace every occurrence of `INVERTER` with your prefix  
   (VS Code: `Ctrl+H`, search `INVERTER`, replace with e.g. `sunsynk`)

3. **Create a new HA dashboard**  
   Settings → Dashboards → Add Dashboard → give it a name (e.g. "Solar")

4. **Paste the YAML**  
   Open the new dashboard → Edit Dashboard (pencil icon) → three-dot menu → Raw Configuration Editor → paste the file content → Save

## HA Energy Dashboard

This integration works out of the box with the built-in Home Assistant **Energy Dashboard** (Settings → Energy). Use the following sensors:

| Energy Dashboard slot | Sensor to select |
|---|---|
| **Solar production** | `PV Generation Total` |
| **Grid consumption** | `Grid Import Total` |
| **Return to grid** | `Grid Export Total` |
| **Battery going in** | `Battery Charge Total` |
| **Battery coming out** | `Battery Discharge Total` |
| **Home consumption** | `Load Total Energy Used` |

> Use the **Total** sensors (lifetime counters), not the **Today** sensors — they give more accurate historical data in the Energy Dashboard.

---

## HA Diagnostics

Download a full diagnostic snapshot of the integration:

**Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → (⋮) → Download diagnostics**

The file includes coordinator state, inverter data, forecast readings and Tariff Manager state. Account details, locations, entity IDs, plant identifiers and serial numbers are automatically redacted before download. Useful when reporting bugs — attach the file to your GitHub issue.

---

## HA Repair Flows

The integration raises issues in the HA **Repair** dashboard automatically:

| Issue | Trigger | Clears when |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication failed | Cloud API rejects credentials | Next successful login |
| Inverter offline | No data returned for a serial number | Next successful data fetch for that serial |

To view current issues: **Settings → System → Repairs**.

---

## HA Services / Actions

Five services are available for use in automations and scripts (**Developer Tools → Actions → sunsynk**). These services require a Home Assistant administrator when called with a user context. System automations without a user context remain allowed; scripts and automations carrying a non-admin user context are rejected. This applies to virtual schedule editing as well as device control. Inverter writes also require Read/write mode and a verified installation profile:

| Service | Description |
|---|---|
| `sunsynk.force_charge` | Set battery charge current from 0–300 A. Call again with your normal value to restore. |
| `sunsynk.force_discharge` | Set battery discharge current from 0–300 A. |
| `sunsynk.set_work_mode` | Set inverter work mode: 0 = Selling First, 1 = Zero Export (Limit to Load), 2 = Limited to Home, 3 = Self Use, 4 = Time of Use. |
| `sunsynk.set_virtual_slot` | Define or replace one of 10 virtual charge/discharge slots for one inverter. |
| `sunsynk.clear_virtual_slot` | Remove one virtual slot from one inverter. |

Every service call targets exactly one logical inverter selected by `serial`.
Independent inverters have independent virtual-slot schedules and tariff runtime
state. In a parallel group, a slave serial is deliberately routed to the master,
because the master owns persistent setting writes; the slave and master therefore
share one virtual-slot schedule.

During an integration unload or options reload, automation listeners are
stopped first. Active tariff currents are restored to their configured normal
values, and Virtual Slot Scheduler restores the physical timer settings it
captured before taking ownership. The API session is closed only after those
restore attempts finish.

All setting writes share a per-inverter queue. Concurrent writes are
serialized and coalesced, while all fields belonging to one physical timer
slot are sent in a single API payload and verified with one read-back.
Before entering that queue, every requested value is validated centrally:
currents are limited to 0–300 A, powers to 0–30,000 W, SOC values to 0–100%,
and modes, booleans and timer strings must use their documented formats.
Invalid batches are rejected atomically without making an API request.

Example automation:
```yaml
action:
  - action: sunsynk.force_charge
    data:
      serial: "SN123456"
      current: 100
```

---

## Tariff Manager Setup

The Tariff Manager automatically charges the battery when electricity is cheap and discharges (sells to grid) when it's expensive. It works with any HA sensor that provides a numeric price. Price thresholds are shared by the config entry, while the active charging/discharging decision is tracked separately for each independent inverter from its own SOC.

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → Configure**
2. Fill in the tariff fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Price sensor** | Any HA sensor with a numeric electricity price (e.g. `sensor.octopus_current_rate`) |
| **Cheap threshold** | Price at or below which charging activates (e.g. `0.10`) |
| **Cheap charge current (A)** | Charge current during cheap rate |
| **Normal charge current (A)** | Current restored when cheap rate ends |
| **Charge target SOC (%)** | Stop charging when battery reaches this SOC (default 100) |
| **Expensive threshold** | Price at or above which discharging activates |
| **Peak discharge current (A)** | Discharge current during expensive rate |
| **Normal discharge current (A)** | Current restored when expensive rate ends |
| **Minimum SOC (%)** | Stop discharging when battery reaches this SOC (default 10) |
| **Active from / Active until** | Optional hours to restrict tariff activity (supports midnight wrap, e.g. 22–06) |
| **Price max age (minutes)** | How old price data can be before it's considered stale (default 90) |

3. After setup, go to your inverter device and **turn on the Tariff Manager switch** — it starts **off** by default.

> Both cheap-rate charging and expensive-rate discharging are independent — configure one, both, or neither.

---

## Solar Forecast Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → Configure**
2. Fill in the forecast fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Panel Peak Power (kWp)** | Total installed panel capacity in kilowatt-peak (e.g. `10.5`) — **required** to enable forecast |
| **Latitude** | Optional — leave blank to use your HA home location |
| **Longitude** | Optional — leave blank to use your HA home location |
| **Performance Ratio** | System efficiency factor 0–1, default `0.80` |

Leave **Panel kWp** blank to disable forecast sensors entirely. Latitude and longitude always fall back to your Home Assistant home location if not filled in.

Forecast data refreshes every **30 minutes**. No API key or account needed.

## Automation Examples

### Notify when battery is low

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Battery Low Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.sunsynk_YOURSERIAL_battery_soc
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Battery SOC below 20%!"
```

### Set zero export at night

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Zero export at night"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "22:00:00"
    action:
      - service: number.set_value
        target:
          entity_id: number.sunsynk_YOURSERIAL_setting_zero_export_power
        data:
          value: 0
```

### Disable grid sell during peak hours

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Disable sell during peak"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "17:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.sunsynk_YOURSERIAL_setting_solar_sell
```

automation:
  - alias: "High charge current when forecast is poor"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.solar_forecast_tomorrow
        below: 5
    action:
      - service: number.set_value
        target:
          entity_id: number.sunsynk_YOURSERIAL_setting_charge_current
        data:
          value: 100
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration fails to authenticate
- Verify your email and password in the [Sunsynk web portal](https://home.sunsynk.net)
- **MFA (2-factor authentication) is not supported** — disable it on your Sunsynk account
- Avoid special characters in your password

### No data / sensors unavailable
- Check your inverter is online in the Sunsynk app (dongle LED should be green)
- The Sunsynk cloud updates data every ~5 minutes — polling faster than 300 s has no benefit
- Check HA logs: **Settings → System → Logs** and filter for `sunsynk`

### Settings not applying
- The Sunsynk cloud may reject out-of-range values
- Some settings require specific inverter firmware versions
- Check HA logs for `sunsynk` errors after attempting a setting change

### MPPT / phase sensors missing
- These are discovered dynamically on first successful data fetch
- If the first fetch failed, restart the integration: **Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → (⋮) → Reload**

### Multiple inverters
- Enter serial numbers separated by a semicolon with no spaces: `SN123456;SN789012`
- Each inverter appears as a separate device in HA

### Tariff Manager not doing anything
- Make sure the **Tariff Manager switch** is turned **on** — it starts off by default
- Check the **Tariff Price Quality** sensor — if it shows `stale`, `unavailable`, or `not_found`, the price sensor is the issue
- Check the **Tariff Mode** sensor — `idle` means the manager is running but price conditions aren't met
- HA persistent notifications appear on every mode change — check the notification bell

### Solar forecast sensors not appearing
- Ensure all three fields (latitude, longitude, panel kWp) are filled in the options form
- Check HA logs for `Open-Meteo request failed` — verify internet access from your HA host
- Reload the integration after saving forecast settings

### Read-only testing

New and existing installations default to **Read-only** when no access mode is
saved. Authentication, polling, forecasting and local virtual-schedule editing
continue, but inverter settings and plant prices cannot be changed by this
integration. Blocked actions report an error rather than success.

Select **Read/write** in **Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → Configure**
to enable writes. Tariff Manager and Virtual Slot Scheduler still need to be
explicitly enabled. Before selecting Read-only again, disable both controllers
and wait for restoration and pending writes to finish. Retry failed restoration
before changing mode. The integration will not perform restoration writes after
read-only is selected.

Read-only does not undo settings already active on your inverters or prevent
changes from other apps. Recovery tracking is currently in memory and does not
provide recovery after a crash. Test against a Home Assistant instance and a test
inverter before relying on write-enabled control.

### Write profiles and installation limits

**Read/write** requires a write profile for every configured inverter. Configure
profiles under **Settings → Devices & Services → Sunsynk → Configure**. The JSON
object is keyed by the physical master serial; each profile lists all members of
that parallel group. A standalone inverter lists only itself. Groups must not
share members, and every member must appear in the integration's serial list.

This example illustrates the format. Replace the serials, both register scopes
and every numeric limit with values confirmed for your installation:

```json
{

- `current_scope` and `power_scope` each accept `per_inverter` or `group`. Confirm
  how the cloud registers apply to your firmware; the integration does not infer
  these scopes or multiply battery-current limits by the number of inverters.
- Current limits must respect your battery/BMS and inverter installation. The
  device's configured battery maximum is an additional limit.
- Power is capped by your approved limit and fresh inverter ratings. Group-scoped
  power uses the sum of member ratings; per-inverter power uses the master's
  rating. Export additionally respects `max_export_power_w`, including zero.
- Enabled timer SOC targets must respect your reserve and the known battery low
  threshold. Shutdown/restart/low SOC relationships and the complete six-slot
  circular time order are checked before writing.
- Some timer slots contain a voltage companion field. To resend it, the profile
  also needs `battery_voltage_min_v` and `battery_voltage_max_v`, both taken from
  your approved battery configuration. Missing bounds or an out-of-range value
  block the write. The integration does not expose voltage editing through this
  profile.

Missing topology, unknown rated power, role changes, incomplete groups and plant
mismatches block writes. Each member is read again before dispatch; selecting a
slave routes to its declared master. Different groups in the same plant remain
separate. There is no fallback to a slave or guessed master.

Battery and system-mode writes send only requested fields. Timer writes retain
required same-slot companions, read them fresh and validate every transmitted
value. Detectable external edits during preparation cause a conflict error.
Read-back checks requested changes and unchanged fields in the affected group.
A failed group stops later groups; earlier groups may already have applied.

Disable controllers and finish restoration/pending writes before changing
profiles. Local schedules remain editable in read-only mode without profiles,
but cannot be enabled until write access and verified profiles are available.
There is no 30 kW fallback for unknown capabilities.

The cloud API provides no compare-and-swap transaction, so an external edit after
the last read can still race a write. Parallel propagation, delayed reversion and
firmware handling of minimal battery/system payloads require validation on your
Home Assistant instance and a test inverter before unattended control.
